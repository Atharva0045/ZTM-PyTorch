# PyTorch for Deep Learning Bootcamp - ZTM Course

Welcome to my repository for the **Zero to Mastery (ZTM) PyTorch for Deep Learning Bootcamp**! üöÄ This repository contains all the notebooks I've completed throughout the course, showcasing hands-on projects, experiments, and deep learning models built with PyTorch.

## üìù Course Overview

The **ZTM PyTorch for Deep Learning Bootcamp** is a comprehensive course focused on deep learning techniques using the PyTorch framework. It covers everything from the basics of neural networks to more advanced topics like Transfer Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the notebooks locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Atharva0045/ztm-pytorch-bootcamp.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   You'll need Python 3.12 and the following libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy pandas jupyterlab
   ```
3. **Run Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open any notebook from the course and start experimenting!
